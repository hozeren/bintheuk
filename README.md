# Bin the UK
It checks bin days specified in JSON file. It is connected to respberry pi and lightning configuration according to bin color for Newcastle.

### To start at boot
I suggest creating a service in arch structure to run pyhton file at boot. Example of creating a service file at boot: [here](https://www.thedigitalpictureframe.com/ultimate-guide-systemd-autostart-scripts-raspberry-pi/).

### Next steps
Automated scrape for bin days is the next step.
